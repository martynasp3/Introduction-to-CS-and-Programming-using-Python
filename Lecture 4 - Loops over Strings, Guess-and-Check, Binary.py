# <QUESTION 1>
# Assume you are given a positive integer variable named N.
# Write a piece of Python code that finds the cube root of N.
# The code prints the cube root if N is a perfect cube or it prints error if N is not a perfect cube.
# Hint: use a loop that increments a counterâ€”you decide when the counter should stop.

# <QUESTION 2>
# Write a for loop over these ranges and prints how many even numbers are in that range
# range(5)
# range(10)
# range(2,9,3)
# range(-4,6,2)
# range(5,6)

# count how many unique letters there are in the string
# "abca" = 3

# or
# this eliminates the need for a count variable, we can just count how many chars in seen string using len()
